# Assignment 3 – Python Functions and Math Module

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains solutions for **Assignment 3**, which focuses on:

* Creating and using **functions in Python**
* Implementing **recursion**
* Using the built-in **math module** for mathematical calculations
* Handling **user input and exceptions**

## 🧮 Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

### 🔹 Problem Statement

Write a Python program that:

1. Defines a function named `factorial` that takes a number as an argument.
2. Calculates the factorial of the number using **recursion**.
3. Returns the calculated factorial.
4. Calls the function with a sample number and prints the result.

### 🔹 Description

* The program asks the user to enter an integer.
* The `factorial()` function recursively multiplies numbers until it reaches 1.
* The final factorial value is displayed.

### 🔹 Sample Output

```
Enter a number: 5
Factorial of 5 is: 120
```

## 📐 Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

### 🔹 Problem Statement

Write a Python program that:

1. Takes a number as input from the user.
2. Uses the **math module** to calculate:

   * Square root of the number
   * Natural logarithm (log base e)
   * Sine of the number (in radians)
3. Displays the calculated results.

### 🔹 Description

* The program continuously prompts the user until a valid number is entered.
* It validates input to ensure positive numbers where required.
* Mathematical functions used:

  * `sqrt()` for square root
  * `log()` for natural logarithm
  * `sin()` for sine value

### 🔹 Sample Output

```
Enter A Number: 25
Square root : 5.0
Logarithm : 3.2188758248682006
Sine : -0.13235175009777303
```
